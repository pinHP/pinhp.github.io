      <ul>        
        <li>18MAY22 
        <br>+ Minor, minor, minor bug fix. Well ... not even a bug, really. Honestly, I simply wanted to release a 4th birthday version :-)

        <li>07MAY22 
        <br>+ Added "Delete Game" option to "P2-Start Button" behaviour

        </li>        
        <li>22APR22 
        <br>+ Support for Quadro cabinets with rotatable monitors. Requires hardware modifications. See this thread (German language forum): https://www.arcadezentrum.com/forum/board/index.php?thread/28556-pi-am-jumbo-quadro 
        <br>+ MAME errors (e. g. messages about missing files), flashing on the screen briefly, are now logged to "rpi2jamma/_MAME_ERROR" on the USB stick for easier debugging.          
        </li>        
        <li>26MAR22 
        <br>+ Added group and filter options: Horizontal/Vertical games.          
        </li>        
        <li>11MAR22 
        <br>- Bugfix: System would crash if orientation was changed, after very first boot with a fresh SD card setup only.          
        </li>        
        <li>27JAN22 
        <br>+ Added option to run AdvanceMENU and AdvanceMESS. If you want to use it instead of the classic pinHP interface, you should know why and how to configure it.          
        </li>        
        <li>26DEC21 
        <br>- Bugfix: Manually setting Coin-Up to "5" inside MAME would delete and reset all MAME settings. 
        <br>- Bugfix: Changing autostart settings would cause game menu to display oversized logos, under certain circumstances, until next reboot.          
        </li>        
        <li>06DEC21 
        <br>+ Added option to directly boot into last game that was played: Options > System Settings > Autostart Last Game 
        <br>+ Alarm Mail: Added option to send a start mail not only with each boot, but in regular intervals (e. g. all 7 days).          
        </li>        
        <li>26OCT21 
        <br>+ Some game filter fine tuning.          
        </li>        
        <li>20OCT21 
        <br>+ Lots of options to filter and group games by genre, manufacturer, system and more. Options &gt; Filter Games and Options &gt; Group Games for actual filtering. Options &gt; Filter Settings to select even more filter values: Select your favourites out of a list of 390 manufacturers, 29 genres and 10 game systems. 
        <br>+ Game menu overhauled. It has grown and grown over the years and got a more logic structure now.          
        </li>        
        <li>04OCT21 
        <br>+ New online update: System Settings Menu &gt; Online Tools &gt; Check for Update &gt; Game settings. Over time, some files like the games definition file or MAME configuration file were updated (e. g. to add new game resolutions, mouse/spinner support, ...). Whenever you restored your settings from a backup after a system update, all those new features were gone. Now you can always check for a "Game settings" update, to include the latest recommended settings.          
        <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMPORTANT         
        </em>: Before any change, the update system will ask for confirmation. There is no risk of losing customized settings.

        </li>        
        <li>27SEP21

        </li>        
        <li>24SEP21 
        <br>+ System boot: No more Linux login message flashing before the boot screen. 
        <br>+ Clean autostart game boot: Boot right into a game, without any sign of emulation (no pinHP boot screen). 
        <br>+ Added screensaver: Run a random game from favourites list. 
        <br>+ Added option to backup favourites settings (System Settings Menu &gt; Game Settings &gt; Backup Fav. Menu). This makes it possible to update the game list template and restore favourites from the backup (System Settings Menu &gt; Game Settings &gt; Restore Fav. Menu). An updated template file, fixing some game names and including joystick 4-8-way information, is available as separate          
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KRgN0hGJq4nB2xvs8JpryLIbPOSkdREh/view?usp=sharing">download</a> (included in the full image). 
        <br>+ Updated, optimized and almost complete sets of game preview logos, marquees and videos are available as separate downloads (logos and marquees are included in the full image). 
        <br>+ Theme settings are now bound to the screen orientation.          
        </li>

        <br>+ Additional video screensaver: Play favourite videos only. 
        <br>+ Monitor Test Card: Flip through eight different test images.          
        </li>        
        <li>21JUL21 
        <br>+ For ServoStik users: Joystick parameter can now be set from the menu: Options &gt; Set Games 4-8-Way 
        <br>+ Select individual game menu text color: System Settings Menu &gt; Screen Settings &gt; Text Color          
        </li>        
        <li>08JUL21 
        <br>+ Added support for Ultimarc&reg; ServoStik (switchable 4-8-way Arcade joystick)          
        </li>        
        <li>26JUN21 
        <br>+ Run an external file, placed in the 'rpi2jamma' base directory, from the menu (System Settings Menu &gt; System Settings &gt; Run External File).<br><strong>Attn. developers</strong>: Since a child process does not have access to its parent's variables, the current pinHP variables are dumped into /tmp/pinhp_variables right before running the external file, making it possible to grep the values. The other way round, if you need to change pinHP variables, you can declare them in /tmp/external_vars. The main script sources this file right after executing the custom script/program.          
        </li>        
        <li>12JUN21 
        <br>+ Maintenance update: Automatically disable custom folders option in System Settings Menu if no ROM subfolders are found, bringing back traditional 1/2/3 line menu selection options.

        </li>        
        <li>02JUN21 
        <br>+ Support for optional custom scripts, to be run before/after a MAME game starts, or during system shutdown. See the example scripts inside /root/scripts/custom. 
        <br>+ BIOS files (e.g. neogeo.zip) for most games are now included und located in a dedicated bios_advmame folder 
        <br>+ Fav. Games are now also available when custom folders are activated. 
        <br>+ Fav. Games handling improved.          
        </li>        
        <li>19MAY21 
        <br>+ Fine tuning and bug fixes of the new 15MAY21 subfolders feature. Switch it on or off: System Settings Menu &gt; Game Menu Settings &gt; Custom Folders).          
        </li>        
        <li>15MAY21 
        <br>+ Subfolders inside the ROM directory are now accepted and will show up in the menu. Individual display names can be set with the ".title" file inside each directory. Write the name into the file and nothing else. Names preceded by a "." (dot) will hide the directory completely, making it inaccessible from the menu. Names preceded by a "#" (hash sign) will show a blank line in the menu, but leave it accessible.

        <li>22APR21 
        <br>+ Change time zone (System Settings Menu &gt; System Settings &gt; Set Time Zone).          
        </li>        
        <li>18APR21 
        <br>+ Installed alternate update server with automatic fallback. 
        <br>+ Wi-Fi credentials are now included in backups. - A bug, not remembering the current number of multiple MAME configurations after restoring from a very old backup, was fixed.          
        </li>        
        <li>16APR21 
        <br>- Bugfix: config.ini file could become corrupt if it was manually edited with a DOS/Windows editor, caused by different format of line endings than files created on Linux (CR/LF vs. LF).

        <a id="release_25MAR21"></a>25MAR21 
        <br>+ Fresh Linux install from scratch. The previous system was still based on an old image from the very beginning of Pi2Jamma, with lots of leftover clutter. 
        <br>+ Rewrite of the game menu generation routine. 90 % speed up. Game menu list containing 6.000 games typically generates within a second now. 
        <br>+ Improved favourites editing: Add a game to the Fav. Games menu, cursor stays in place at the next game in the list.

        <br>- Bugfix: When "Fav." button (Player2-Start) is defined to change screen orientation (System Settings Menu &gt; System Settings &gt; P2-Start), the pinHP menu now stays at the same line from where orientation change was activated

        <br>+ Just a gimmick: Select the date to be set when the system boots. There is no hardware clock in a Raspberry Pi, so the system date will always be wrong unless there is an Internet connection. Select between image date, last shutdown date or a custom date.
